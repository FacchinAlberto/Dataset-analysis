# Dataset-analysis
In this repository there is an R Markdown file which cointains the code for analysing a dataset downloaded from kaggle.com and its respective html.

At the beginning I did an exploratory data analysis and then I used three models for every selected couple of variabes (one conditionally to the other) and choose the best one
considering R squadred, kurtosis index and others parameters.
In conclusion I used the best model for making a prediction.
