# Dataset-analysis
In this repository there is an R Markdown file which cointains the code for analysing a dataset (wholesale) downloaded from kaggle.com and its respective html.

At the beginning, me and my collagues, did an exploratory data analysis and then we used three models for every selected couple of variabes (one conditionally to the other) and choosen the best one
considering R squadred, kurtosis index and others parameters.
At the end the best linear regression model has been used for making a prediction.
